# platformGame
My own 2D platform game coded in Processing3 (JAVA)

Purpose: My goal with this game is to practice Java skills and have something to show for during the quarantine. 
I chose developing a game because it's one of my passions and its extremely interactive  project.


The game is still in development
Once fully developed, an executable file will be available.
