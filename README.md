# platformGame
My own 2D platform game coded in Processing3 (JAVA)

Purpose: My goal with this game is to practice Java skills and have something to show for during the quarantine. 
I chose developing a game because it's one of my passions and its extremely interactive  project.


The game is still in development, however an executable file is available (application.windows32).

Next Updates:
- Display a counter for which player wins in each scene
- Add different projectile images
- Upgrade menu and last page

Long Term Updates:
- Add different characters
- More maps
- Add double jump feature
